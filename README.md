In this project we get our data which are all laptops with details from digikala using beautiful soup and save them in the database . 
mongoDB is used as database . and the program will be running every two days with crontab in linux . 

scikit learn gets all data like {ram , cpu , model of the laptop , ...} and learns the price of the laptops . 

so by inserting the detials of the laptop , the program will offer you a price and a link in digikala so you can buy your laptop .  



Run the fetch_data.py for getting data from the site or updating your database (can be done by cronetab)
Run the machine.py for getting input from user to predict the laptop price.

In the first version of this code the internal memory is ignored which will be added in the close future
and the links of laptops will be shown in the new version for you to easy buy your favirote laptop

Thanks for your time .
